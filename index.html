 <p>The Three Parts of a Paragraph<br/>
   <p>All paragraphs have a topic sentence and supporting sentences, and some paragraphs apse have a concluding sentence. </p>
  
<p>1. The Topic Sentences<br/>
<p>The topic sentences states the main idea of the paragraph. It not only names the topic of the paragraph,but it also limits the topic to one specific area that can be discussed completely in the space of a single paragraph. The part of the topic sentence that announces the specific area to be discussed is called the controlling idea. Notice how the topic sentence of the model states both the topic and the controlling idea.</p>
<p>Example<br/>
<p>Gold, a precious metal, is prized for two important characteristics.</p>

<p>2. Supporting Sentences<br/>

<p> Supporting sentences develop the topic sentence. That is, They explain or prove the topic sentence by giving more information about it. Following are some of the supporting sentences that explain the topic sentence about gold.</p>

<p> Example<br/>

<p> First of all, gold has a lustrous beauty that is resistant to corrosion.</p>
<p>For example, a Macedonian coin remains as untarnished today as the day it was made 25 centuries ago.</p>

<p> Another important characteristic of gold is its usefulness to industry and science.</p>
<p> The most recent use of gold is in astronauts' suits.</p>



<p>3. The Concluding Sentences <br/>

<p> The concluding sentences signals the end of the paragraph and leaves the reader with important points to remember;</p>

<p> Example<br/>

<p> In conclusion, gold is treasured not only for its beauty but also for its utility.</p>


<p> * Concluding sentences are customary for stand- alone paragraphs. However, paragraphs that are parts of a longer piece of writing usually do not need concluding sentence.</p>


   
   
      





<p> Habits of Successful People<br/>

<p>


There are many people all over the world. Some of them are successful and some of them are not.People who succeed in their lives have many good habits,which make people different.</P>

<p> first of all, they know what they want to be. what they want to get and what they want to do. They have their exact goals.They are many strategies to reach their goals. For example, Thomas Alva Edson made experiments a thousand times to create a bulb. He never gave up until he reached his goal.</p>
<p> In addition, being eager to learn is their second major good habit to be a successful person. They are alway learners in their lives. They learn something they want to know systematically. They devote their lives to the subject they learned. For instance, Beethoven is a good example.Although he was getting deaf, facing financial problems, and getting poor health in his later life, he learned music and composed his last symphony.
</P>
<p> The most important good habit they have is keeping their health well. They know that if they are not healthy, they can do nothing. They keep their health in good shape by eating on time, sleeping for the right time and doing exercise regularly. Gandhi is a good example here.</p>
<p> In conclusion, we can see easily that there are many good habit which can make people achieve their goals and be successful people.</p>
<p>National Holiday<br/>
<p>There are several national holiday in my country, but the most important one is the national day holiday because on this day everyone in the country celebrates and we share the congratulations and we set up a big party in every region in my country. I will mention below what we do on this important day.</p>
<p>First of all, in my country we consider the national day as a big and significant event. Therefore, we prepare everything before it comes. For instance, we put screens in the streets to view the history of our country that is broadcast. Furthermore, we put the flag of my country on our car and homes. Secondly, after we perform the actions which I mentioned above on the first day, we prepare for the second day. </P>
<p> Actually, the second day is very amazing because we should go to a big celebration in the country. There are important characters who attend this important event. In this carnival, they show us something concerning our old generation.They tell us about our old history.</P>
<p> On the third day we present the national gift from the children to the adults.</p>
<p>In conclusion, what I mentioned above makes us look forward to the national day year after year. On a normal day we miss the national day because this day is important for every person in my country.</p>

<p>Symptoms of Culture Shock<br/>
<p> Every country and every ethnic group have their own culture. Some of them have a lot in common, but some of them are very different. When you make a trip form country to country, you will meet new experiences, new places, and new culture will not be accepted in the new place easily, and everything will be different.When you feel like that, it is called culture shock. it has many symptoms,depending on the individual.</p>
<p>first of all, a feeling of loneliness and sadness is a symptom of culture shock you will face. For example, after you have arrived in the new country that is very different from your native country, you may encounter some problems such as communication difficulties, and no acquaintances. In this situation, you will feel impatience, anger, and discontent. Finally, you will feel loneliness and sadness.</p>
<p> Furthermore, insomnia is one of the symptoms of culture shock. After the failure of communication with others, you won't want to go outside, and when you feel loneliness, you won't to do anything. You will always stay in your room, and do something that is nonsense, or you will always be in your bed sleeping only a little. It is called insomnia.</p>
<p>The third one is depression. Although you are trying to adapt to the new culture that is very different from your culture, you will feel dissatisfaction for it takes a long time to adapt to the new one. As a consequence, you feel depression, which makes you feel like dying.</P>
<p> In conclusion, everyone who moves to another country will face culture shock a little or a lot. That's why, before you go to another country, you should remember that there are many symptoms of culture shock and prepare your attitude to adapt to the new culture.</P>

<p>Cause of Obesity in America<br/>
<p> There are many causes of obesity in America. Obesity happens at any age. Most 
Americans have become obese,and that is a big problem in America. People have become unhealthy and very fat. The three cause of obesity in America are fast food, the lack of exercise, and bad habits.</p>
<p> The first cause of obesity is fast food. There are many fast food restaurants in America. The fast food is very popular. It is easy to find, it saves money, and it saves time. Most employees choose to eat fast food. The fast food has a lot of fat and no vegetables. As a result, American people are unhealthy and have become fat.</p>
<p> The  second cause of obesity is a lack of exercise. Most of the American people don't like to exercise. When they have free time, they like to sit down and sleep. On the other hand, may be they don't have time to exercise and go to work every day. Exercise can burn your calories and release waste from your body.</p>
<p> The third cause of obesity is bed habits. People like to sit down and watch TV all day  or play on the internet. They eat snacks while they play on the internet. Most of the American people are drinkers and smokers. Alcohol causes obesity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, most of the Americans have become obese because of poor nutrients, the lack of exercise, and bad habits. To become healthier is very easy. Just eat healthy food which includes a lot of vegetables or fiber. Also, do a lot of exercise and stop the bad habits.</P>


<p>Video Games<br/>

<p>
Most kids and most guys like playing video games. Although some people think that parent should allow their children to play video games because some educational video games are very good for kids,I think that parents should not allow their children to play video games because of too many reasons.</p>
<p> The first reason why I am against video games is that some people develop health problems. When the people are playing video games, most people just watch the screen of the T.V, so most people get eye problems. For example, one to my friends likes playing video games all the time, so he has big glasses because he cannot see anything without the  glasses.</p>
<p> The second reason why I am against video games is that video games create too many problems for the family because the system and the CD's of the video games are too expensive. parents and children have too many problems because parents cannot buy the expensive CD's for their children. Most children like the new system, but the new system is expensive. Their children will cause a big problem with the parents if the parents cannot buy the new system for their children.</p>
<p> Although some people believe video games are educational,I disagree that video games help the kids to study. Many people believe video games help with knowledge;however,video games are violent, so most kids want to fight with each other,and most kids are thinking about violence as result of these games.</P>

<p> In conclusion, playing video games all the time is too bad for the kids; therefore, parents should not allow their children to play video games.</p>

<p> " The Problems of My Home Country's City"</p>


<p> My native is City Tavoy, Tenasserm division,Burma. As you know, there is no perfect city in the world. Every city has problems, more or less. My home city has many problems that we need to solve right away.</P>

<p> The first problem of my mother city is transportation. My country is not a developed country. That's why my native city doesn't have good transportation. For example, there is  neither a bud system nor a subway system inside the city. People from my home city use the carts pulled by a horse and bicycles as public transportation. Furthermore, there is no traffic light in my home city, and the streets are very narrow. Therefore, it is common to hear daily about small accidents on the road.</p>
<p> The second problem of my native city is the unemployment issue. Although you have a bachelor's degree or a higher education, it is difficult to get a job because the government can't create job opportunities.As a consequence,people face poverty.For example, I 've four siblings in my city,and they all have already got bachelor degrees. But they have no job till now.</p>

<p>The third and most important problem of my home city is the administration system, Because it is a military government, under this system, no one can act creatively,and say Their political opinion openly. The authorities make many rules and regulations for the people, but they stay above the law. Furthermore, every department takes bribes including the education department. We have to pay bribes to the teacher to get good marks and to pass an exam. Although you fail, you can pass if you pay a bribe. There problems occur because of the government system.</p>
<p> In conclusion, it is clear that there are many problems in my native city under the military government and we need to take action for these problems.</p>
