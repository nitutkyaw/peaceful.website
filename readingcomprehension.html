<H1>American Classroom Customs</H1></CENTER>
Read this, then answer the questions at the bottom of the page.<P><OL><P><LI>If the teacher asks a question, you are expected to give an answer.
If you do not understand the question, you should raise your hand and ask
the teacher to repeat the question. If you do not know the answer, it is
all right to tell the teacher that you do not know. Then he or she knows
what you need to learn.<P><LI>There is <B><U>no excuse</U></B> for not doing your homework. If you
are absent, you should call your teacher or someone who is in your class
and ask for the assignment. It is <B><U>your</U></B> responsibility to
find out what assignments you have missed. It is not the teacher's responsibility
to remind you of missed assignments.<P><LI>You must not be absent on a test day. If you are seriously ill, call
and let the teacher know you will not be there for the test. If your teacher
allows make-up tests, you should take the test within one or two days after
returning to class. Serious illness is the <B><U>only</U></B> reason for
missing a test.<P><LI>Be on time! It is considered rude to be late. Also, it bothers other
students. If you must come in late, be sure to do it quietly. Have your
books and papers out of your bag before you come into the room. Then go
to your seat and sit quietly. In the U.S. it is not necessary to knock
before you enter the classroom. Most of the ELC teachers will give you
a low grade if you are often late.<P><LI>Have your book out and be ready to begin when the class starts. Your
teacher should not have to ask you every day to take out your book. Be
sure you have a paper and a sharp pencil ready.<P><LI>In America, you should call your teacher by his or her last name, not
&quot;teacher&quot;. Also you should use Mr., Miss, Ms. or Mrs. before
the last name (such as Mrs. Smith or Mr. Jones). This is considered polite.
The teacher will tell you his or her preferred title.<P><LI>Be courteous to other students. If another student is answering a question,
giving a report or an explanation, you should listen quietly and give them
your attention. Everyone must be treated with the same respect you would
like them to give to you. Also, the question they are asking may be something
you need to know.<P><LI>It is considered impolite in the U.S. to eat, drink or chew gum during
class. This is reserved for the break. Also, removing one's shoes in the
classroom is not polite.<P><LI>If you must leave during class, do so quietly. There is no need to
ask the teacher's permission. However, leaving the class for something
other than an emergency is not acceptable. (Getting a drink or sharpening
your pencil is not considered an emergency.)<P><LI>Copying another student's test or paper is never acceptable. It is
called <B><I>cheating</I></B>. At BYU and most schools in the U.S., students
who cheat are expelled (kicked out).<P><LI>Posters, bulletin boards, or any other thing hanging on the wall is
considered property of the school and shouldn't be written on or removed
without permission. (A sign-up sheet may be written on, but only put your
name on it.)<P><LI>It is not acceptable to put up any sign, announcement or advertisement
without first getting permission from the school office.<P><LI>Books, backpacks, lunches--anything that belongs to other people is
considered private and should not be moved or tampered with.<P><LI>Entering a teacher's office or any office with a closed door without
knocking first is not acceptable. Knock first, then wait to be invited
in.<P><LI>It is not considered polite to yell at people to get their attention.
When talking in a group, you should not speak so loudly as to disrupt others
who are close by.<P><LI>Wearing a hat in class is considered impolite by many teachers. Some
teachers/programs may ignore it, but you should ask permission first.

<H1>Job Goals</H1> By Linda Blake Smith</CENTER>
<P>To find the job that is right for you, you must set goals. A goal is a purpose you set for yourself. It is what you hope for in the future. You have to identify the skills that you need to get the job you want. Then you need to design a program to help you reach the level of improvement you set for yourself.
<P>To reach your goal, you must have a specific goal. Decide what you are going to do and when you are going to do it. Plan ways to achieve your goal. How will you accomplish it? Next, identify problems that will get in the way of accomplishing your goal. Then think of possible ways to solve the problems. Finally, evaluate your progress. Did you reach your goal?

<h1>Personal Qualities</H1>By Linda Blake Smith</CENTER>
<P>Personal qualities are personal characteristics of an individual. They are what make up one's personality. They help a person get along in a new situation. For example, dependability and patience are qualities that employers would like a good worker to have. Other qualities employers value are: honesty, assertiveness, flexibility, problem solving, friendliness, intelligence, leadership, enthusiasm, and a good sense of humor.
<P>Most employers want people who are dependable and who get along with others.

<h1> Job Skills</H1>By Linda Blake Smith</CENTER>
<P>Skills are the activities that a person does well. What things are you good at doing? Everyone has many skills. Sometimes it is difficult to recognize the skills that you have.
<P>Job skills are abilities you need for a specific job. For example, a chef needs to know how to cook and bake. A taxi driver needs to know how to drive a car and read signs. A secretary needs to know how to type and take messages.
<P>Transferable skills are skills you can use in many different jobs. You can take skills from one job and use them in a very different job. Speaking English well, for instance, is a skill you can use in almost any job. Some examples of transferable skills are teaching other people, solving problems, accepting responsibility, organizing projects, making decisions, and creating new ideas. Employers want to select employees who have or who can learn the skills necessary to do the job.
<BR>This quiz is part of the <a href="/q/h/">HTML-Only Self-Study Quizzes</a> which is part of <a href="/">Activities for ESL Students</a>, a project by <a href="http://iteslj.org/">The Internet TESL Journal</a>.</font></center></body></html>

<H1> <Job Duties> Job Duties</H1>By Linda Blake Smith</CENTER>
<P>Job duties are tasks you must do on a job. They are the responsibilities you have for a particular job. A job description lists the duties you will do for your job. For example, an auto mechanic would repair and paint cars. A file clerk would file forms, answer the telephones, and sort mail. A bookkeeper would prepare bills, keep books, and type bills.

<H1>Walking In</H1> By Linda Blake Smith</CENTER>
<P>When a business has a job opening, this business is looking for a new worker. Many businesses put "Help Wanted" signs in the window when they have job openings. When you see "Help Wanted" signs, you can go into companies and ask about jobs. This is called "walking in." Sometimes companies have job openings, but they don't put up signs. You can walk into these companies and ask about jobs. When you walk into a company, the first person you talk to is usually the receptionist or another employee. Later, you can sometimes talk to the manager. <HR> <font size=3> Decide what the answer should be, then click on the answer button to see the hidden answer.</font> <hr> </CENTER><OL> <LI><FORM>When a business has a job opening, the business is looking for a new worker.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> True </SELECT></FORM> <LI><FORM>All businesses put "Help Wanted" signs in the window when they have job openings.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> False </SELECT></FORM> <LI><FORM>When you see "Help Wanted" signs, you can't go into the companies and ask about jobs.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> False </SELECT></FORM> <LI><FORM>Sometimes companies have job openings, but they don't put up signs.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> True </SELECT></FORM> <LI><FORM>You can walk into any company and ask about jobs.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> True </SELECT></FORM> <LI><FORM>When you walk into a company, the first person you talk to is usually the boss.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> False </SELECT></FORM> </OL>

<H1> Want Ads </H1> By Linda Blake Smith</CENTER>
<P>Want ads are messages in the newspaper where you can find out about many different things. They are also known as the classified advertising section and you can find out about job openings there. The "Help Wanted" section is a part of the newspaper with want ads placed by people who have jobs to fill. After you find the "Help Wanted" or "Employment" section, you will see other titles under these general titles. They are called subheadings. For example, you can look under the subheading "Office" or "Clerical" if you have special skills as a secretary or typist. The jobs are listed in alphabetical order under the subheadings.
<P>You can read the want ads to learn general information about available jobs or to learn specific information about a particular job that interests you. Reading the want ads will help you better understand the jobs that are available. However, only a small group of people get jobs through the want ads. Often the jobs offered are entry level jobs or beginning jobs. If you have little experience as a worker, want ads may help you find the job you looking for. <CENTER><HR> <font size=3> Decide what the answer should be, then click on the answer button to see the hidden answer.</font> <hr></CENTER> <OL> <LI><FORM>Want ads are <SELECT><OPTION>___<OPTION> messages </SELECT> in the newspaper where you can find out about many different things.</FORM> <LI><FORM>They are also known as the <SELECT><OPTION>___<OPTION> classified </SELECT> advertising section, and you can find out about job openings there.</FORM> <LI><FORM>The <SELECT><OPTION>___<OPTION> "Help Wanted" </SELECT> section is a section with want ads placed by people who have jobs to fill.</FORM> <LI><FORM>After you find the "Help Wanted" or <SELECT><OPTION>___<OPTION> "Employment" </SELECT> section, you will see other titles under these general titles.</FORM> <LI><FORM>They are called <SELECT><OPTION>___<OPTION> subheadings </SELECT> .</FORM> <LI><FORM>For example, you can look under the subheading <SELECT><OPTION>___<OPTION> "office" or "clerical" </SELECT> if you have special skills as a secretary or typist.</FORM> <LI><FORM>The jobs are listed in <SELECT><OPTION>___<OPTION> alphabetical </SELECT> order.</FORM> <LI><FORM>Reading the want ads will help you better understand the jobs that are <SELECT><OPTION>___<OPTION> available </SELECT>.</FORM> <LI><FORM>Only a <SELECT><OPTION>___<OPTION> small </SELECT> group of people get jobs through the want ads.</FORM> <LI><FORM>Often the jobs offered are entry level jobs or <SELECT><OPTION>___<OPTION> beginning </SELECT> jobs.</FORM>

<h1> Job Announcements</H1>By Linda Blake Smith</CENTER>
<P>Job announcements are also called job listings. They have the same information as want ads, but you do not find job announcements in the newspaper.

<H1>Networking</H1>By Linda Blake Smith</CENTER>
<P>The most effective way to find a job is through networking. Family, friends, neighbors, people you worked with in your last job, classmates, and other people you know can help you find a job. Ask them to help you. This is called networking. You can begin networking with anyone who knows people and is willing to talk to you. The people you are then referred to are likely to know even more about the job you want. Each referral will try to be helpful and refer you to someone who knows even more than they do.
<P>You need to convince the people you see that you have the skills to do a good job. They must like you, or it will be difficult to get them to help you.

<H1> Job Application</H1>By Linda Blake Smith</CENTER>
<P>A completed job application provides the employer with two kinds of information about you. First, it provides answers to questions about your education and work experience. Second, it provides information about your ability to follow directions, work neatly, spell correctly, and provide accurate and complete data. This information is provided by "how" you fill out the application form.
<P>A completed job application is a statement about your personal, educational, and work experience. It is also a statement about some of your other very important characteristics as a person and as a prospective employee.

<h1> Resume </h1> By Linda Blake Smith</CENTER>
<P>A resume is an individualized, written summary of your personal, educational and experience qualifications. It is designed to present <I>you</I> as a prospective employee. Not everyone needs a resume. However, if you are looking for a professional, technical, administrative, or managerial job, you will need a resume. Applications for many clerical and sales positions also require a resume.
<P>A resume is like a written sales presentation. It alone will not get you a job. However, an effective resume creates a favorable impression of you while presenting your abilities and experience. Your resume can be used as a response to an ad. It can also be used as a letter of introduction for an interview. It is a fact sheet that tells a prospective employer that you are a desirable prospective employee. <HR> <font size=3> Read each sentence carefully. Choose the best word to fill in the blank.

><H1>Interview</H1> By Linda Blake Smith</CENTER>
<P>An interview is a meeting between an employer and an applicant to talk about a job. A job interview is your opportunity to present your skills to an employer in person. During the interview, an employer judges your qualifications, appearance, and general fitness for the job opening. The interview is your opportunity to convince the employer that you are right for the job.
<P>The interview also gives you a chance to evaluate the job, the employer, and the company. The interview helps you decide if the job meets your career needs and interests.
<P>It is very important to prepare for a job interview. If you prepare well, the interviewer will know that you are organized and that you are really interested in the job. If you learn as much as you can about the job and the company before the interview, and if you are careful about your appearance, then you will make a good impression. If you practice the interview questions that managers usually ask, then you will feel confident when you speak. <HR> <font size=3> Decide what the answer should be, then click on the answer button to see the hidden answer.</font> <hr> </CENTER><OL> <LI><FORM>An interview is a meeting between an employer and an applicant to talk about a job.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> True </SELECT></FORM> <LI><FORM>A job interview is your opportunity to present your job duties in person to an employer.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> False </SELECT></FORM> <LI><FORM>During the interview, an employer judges your qualifications and appearance.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> True </SELECT></FORM> <LI><FORM>The interview is your opportunity to convince the employer that you are wrong for the job.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> False </SELECT></FORM> <LI><FORM>The interview gives you a chance to evaluate the employer and company.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> True </SELECT></FORM> <LI><FORM>It is not very important to prepare for a job interview.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> False </SELECT></FORM> <LI><FORM>If you prepare well, the interviewer will know that you are organized and that you are really interested in the job.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> True </SELECT></FORM> <LI><FORM>If you learn as much as you can about the job and the company before the interview, and if you are careful about your appearance, then you will make a good impression.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> True </SELECT></FORM> <LI><FORM>If you don't practice the interview questions that managers usually ask, then you will feel confident when you speak.<BR><SELECT><OPTION> True or False<OPTION> False </SELECT></FORM> </UL>

</OL></FORM><P>Your body has some power to fight disease. This is called your body's immune system. HIV is a virus that weakens the body's immune system or power to fight disease. HIV can pass from one person to another through body fluids like blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or a mother's breast milk.<P>HIV causes AIDS but not everyone who has HIV looks sick. It can take from two to ten or more years before someone who is HIV+ becomes sick with AIDS. The only way to find out if someone has HIV is for them to get tested for the virus.<P>HIV can pass from one person to another through unprotected sex with someone who is infected with HIV. HIV can pass from one person to another through sharing needles for drugs. HIV can also pass from a mother to her baby during pregnancy (before the baby is born) or through breast feeding, from the mother's milk. But only about 1/3 of babies of HIV+ mothers are infected this way.<P>Right now, there is no way to cure AIDS. People who become infected with HIV, become sick with AIDS after six months to ten years. Eventually, they die. There are some medicines to fight AIDS, but nothing yet that cures it. Scientists around the world are trying to find a cure for AIDS.<P>The main way that HIV is passed from person to person is through unprotected sex with a person who is HIV infected. Thinking carefully about sex, discussing sex with your partner and trying to have safe sex (for example using a condom during sex) are some ways that HIV infection can be reduced. <UL> HIV is very weak outside of the body and difficult to catch.<P><LI>You cannot catch AIDS from visiting or talking to a friend who is sick with AIDS.<P><LI>You cannot catch AIDS from hugging or kissing a friend who has HIV/AIDS.<P><LI>You cannot catch AIDS from mosquito bites or insect bites.<P><LI>You cannot catch AIDS from a toilet seat in a public restroom.<P><LI>You cannot catch AIDS from going to the same school with someone who is sick with AIDS.<P><LI>You cannot catch AIDS from being kind to someone who has AIDS. </UL> AIDS is an international problem which touches people in every country of the world.

Natural Similarities and Opposites
<BR>in Two Poems by Joseph Ceravolo
</CENTER>
<P>Sometimes poets use opposite or contradictory statements to express many sides of a feeling. After all, smooth surfaces can be dangerous (think of the flat surface of a deep lake, for instance). Joseph Ceravolo was an American poet who often mixed similar and opposite ideas in his verse. In the following two poems Ceravolo suggests that natural objects that we often take for granted can be viewed as extraordinary, even unnatural. Ceravolo looks at trees and finds they contain wild feelings.

<H1>Marconi and the Radio</H1>
Read this, then answer the questions at the bottom of the page.
</CENTER><P>Guglielmo Marconi was born in Italy in 1874. He studied in Bologna and
since his childhood, he showed great interest in physics and electricity.
Basing his studies on Hertz's findings, Marconi concluded that the electromagnetic
waves could transmit messages, so he conducted his research in that direction.<P>As Marconi did not get any financial incentives from the Italian government,
he moved to England where he got funds for his research.<P>In 1897, Marconi was able to communicate via radio through the Bristol Channel.
In 1901, he transmitted long-wave radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean.
At that time, Marconi was already recognized as a great name in science and technology.<P>In 1909, he shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun, a German physicist, who
worked on wireless telegraphy and cathode rays.<P>Marconi died in 1937.
