<p> Simple Sentence<br/>


<p>A simple sentence has the most basic elements that make it a sentence: a subject, a verb, and a completed thought.</p>

<p>Examples of simple sentences include the following:</p>

 <ul>     
 <li>   Joe waited for the train.</li>
  <li>   "Joe" = subject, "waited" = verb</li>
 
   <li>The train was late.</li>
   <li>"The train" = subject, "was" = verb</li>
 
    <li>Mary and Samantha took the bus.</li>
     <li>"Mary and Samantha" = compound subject, "took" = verb</li>
 
     <li>I looked for Mary and Samantha at the bus station.</li>
      <li>"I" = subject, "looked" = verb</li>
 
<li>Mary and Samantha arrived at the bus station before noon and left on the bus before I arrived.</li>
   <li>"Mary and Samantha" = compound subject, "arrived" and "left" = compound verb </li>

</ul>












<p> Compound Sentence<br/>

<p>


A compound sentence refers to a sentence made up of two independent clauses (or complete sentences) connected to one another with a coordinating conjunction. Coordinating conjunctions are easy to remember if you think of the words "FAN BOYS":</p>

<ul>
<li>For</li>
<li>And</li>
<li>Nor</li>
<li>But</li>
<li>Or</li>
<li>Yet</li>
<li>So </li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of compound sentences include the following:</p>

<p>Joe waited for the train, but the train was late.</p>
 
<p>I looked for Mary and Samantha at the bus station, but they arrived at the station before noon and left on the bus before I arrived.</p>
 
<p>Mary and Samantha arrived at the bus station before noon, and they left on the bus before I arrived.</p>
 
<p>Mary and Samantha left on the bus before I arrived, so I did not see them at the bus station.</p>

<p> Complex Sentence <br/>

<p>A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and one or more dependent clauses connected to it. A dependent clause is similar to an independent clause, or complete sentence, but it lacks one of the elements that would make it a complete sentence. </p>

<p>Examples of dependent clauses include the following:</p>

<uL>


<li>because Mary and Samantha arrived at the bus station before noon</li>
<li>while he waited at the train station</il>
 <li>after they left on the bus</li>
<li>Dependent clauses such as those above cannot stand alone as a sentence, but they can be added to an independent clause to form a complex sentence.</li>

<li>Dependent clauses begin with subordinating conjunctions. Below are some of the most common subordinating conjunctions:</li>

<li>after</li>
<li>although</li>
<li>as</li>
<li>because</li>
<li>before</li>
<li>even though</li>
<li>if</li>
<li>since</li>
<li>though</li>
<li>unless</li>
<li>until</li>
<li>when</li>
<li>whenever</Li>
<li>whereas</li>
<li>wherever</li>
<li>while</li>
<p>A complex sentence joins an independent clause with one or more dependent clauses.</p>

<p>The dependent clauses can go first in the sentence, followed by the independent clause, as in the following:</p>

<p>Complex sentences are often more effective than compound sentences because a complex sentence indicates clearer and more specific relationships between the main parts of the sentence. The word "before," for instance, tells readers that one thing occurs before another. A word such as "although" conveys a more complex relationship than a word such as "and" conveys.</p>

<p>The term periodic sentence is used to refer to a complex sentence beginning with a dependent clause and ending with an independent clause, as in "While he waited at the train station, Joe realized that the train was late."</p>

<p>Periodic sentences can be especially effective because the completed thought occurs at the end of it, so the first part of the sentence can build up to the meaning that comes at the end.</p>
